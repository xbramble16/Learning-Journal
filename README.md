# Welcome to my Learning Journal

## Introduction
My name is Xandria Bramble and I'm 16 years old. I currently attend Triple C School and I'm in 11th Grade.

I'm a born Caymanian, but I'm not fully Caymanian. My father's from Kingston, Jamaica and my mother is from West Bay, Grand Cayman.
Music is a part of me. 

I do Music Theory in school, I play in the Highschool Band, I am apart of the Senior Vocal Troupe and do flute lesssons at Musicians Limited. My main instrument is flute which I have been playing since I was 9 years old. I also play piccolo in Band when it's needed. 

Another instrument I play for events like church services or worship at school, I play my guitar. 

When I graduate from highschool, I want to study computer science or software engineering when I go to university.
