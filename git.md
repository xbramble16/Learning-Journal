# Git
## Seeing Your Remotes
- When the **(git remote)** command has been run, you'll be able to view the short names, like "origin", out of all the specified remote handles.
- When you run the command **(command remote -v)** has ran, all the remote URLs will appear next to their corresponding short names.

### Example:

```
  $ cd example
  $ git remote -v
  remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)
  remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)
  remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch)
  remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push)
  remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch)
  remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)  
```
